### Project Highlights
  * Applied preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
  * Analyzed PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
  * Clustered a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
  * Assess information given by cluster data to interpret it in a meaningful way.
  
### General Descriptions
  * Leveraged unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.
